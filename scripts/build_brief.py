PROJECT_GUIDE = """# {name}

A demo website being built for {name}, a business that will be approached cold
with the finished result.

## What is here

- `brief.md` — everything about the business and the full instruction for the
  site. Read it before writing a line. The section named **Build prompt** is the
  instruction and it stands on its own.
- `assets/` — the photographs. Some are stock, some may be the business's own.
  `brief.md` lists every one of them under **Images**, with where it belongs on
  the page and which of the two it is. That list is the authority, not the
  folder names.
- `site/` — where the website goes. It is empty until someone builds it.

## What to do here

Write the site into `site/`, in the stack `brief.md` names. For plain HTML that
is `index.html`, `style.css` and `script.js`. Nothing else in this folder gets
edited.

## Rules that are not negotiable

- The stack is decided in `brief.md` under **Build prompt**. Follow it. Whatever
  it says, the production build has to end up as a static bundle that runs on
  any host with no server behind it.
- Serve the site and look at it before saying it is finished. Never hand over a
  page nobody has opened.
- Mobile first. Check 360px wide before anything else.
- Image paths are relative: `../assets/` followed by the path **Images** gives
  for that photograph, written exactly as it appears there. Do not guess a path
  from a folder name: a photograph sitting in `exterior/` belongs at the top of
  the page, and the brief is what says so.
- Every visible word is in {language}.
- Real, from `brief.md`, and never changed: {known_facts}.
- Not known: {unknown_facts}. Write an obvious placeholder in {language} for
  each and list every placeholder in an HTML comment at the bottom of
  `index.html`. Never invent a review or a person.
- No lorem ipsum anywhere.

## Build prompt

Everything below is the instruction for whoever builds the site. It is written
to stand on its own, so it repeats facts from above on purpose.

---

Build a complete one page website for **{name}**, a {trade} in {city}. Write it
into the `site/` folder next to this file. The entry point is
`site/index.html`.

**The pitch this site has to win.** {pitch} The owner has never seen this site
and has not paid for it. It is being sent to them cold, so it has to look like
something they would have paid for. Anything that reads as a template loses the
job.

**Stack: {stack}.** {stack_reason}

**Technical constraints, all of them hard.**

{stack_rules}
- Mobile first. Design the phone layout first and let the desktop layout be the
  variation. Test mentally at 360px wide before anything else.
- Every image lives in `../assets/` relative to `site/index.html`. Use the exact
  filenames listed above. Do not invent filenames and do not hotlink anything.
- Add `width`, `height` and `loading="lazy"` to every image below the fold, so
  the page does not jump while it loads.
- `<title>`, `<meta name="description">` and `<meta name="viewport">` are
  mandatory. Those three are exactly what the audit judges a site on, so a site
  built here must not fail its own test.
- Include Open Graph tags, a favicon, and JSON-LD `LocalBusiness` structured
  data filled in with {known_facts}, exactly as the table above gives them.
  Leave out of it anything the table does not give.
- Semantic HTML: one `<h1>`, sections in `<section>`, navigation in `<nav>`,
  contact details in a `<footer>`. Every image needs a real `alt` in
  {language}.
- Colour contrast at least 4.5:1 for body text. Tap targets at least 44px.
- No cookie banner, no analytics, no third party fonts loaded from a CDN. If a
  display font is wanted, pick a system font stack instead.

**Language.** Every word the visitor reads is in {language}. Do not mix
languages. Do not leave lorem ipsum anywhere — write real copy for this
business, in the voice of a {trade} that wants local customers.

**What to invent and what not to.** Real, taken from the table above and never
changed: {known_facts}. Not known: {unknown_facts}. Where a section needs
something not known, write an obvious placeholder in {language} that the owner
can fill in, and mark those spots in a `<!-- -->` comment list at the bottom of
`index.html` so they are easy to find. Never invent a fake review or a fake
person.

**Sections, in this order.**

{sections}
**Style direction.** {style}

Build the palette from that description{colour_hint}. Pick one accent colour
and use it for every call to action, nothing else. Two typefaces at most.
Generous whitespace, a consistent spacing scale, and a single border radius
used everywhere.

**Animation.** {animation_rule}

**Performance.** The whole page, images included, should feel instant on a
phone. Keep total JavaScript small, defer anything that is not needed for the
first paint, and never block rendering on a script.

**When it is done**, serve the site and look at it. Never hand it over unseen.
Open it at 360px wide first, then at desktop width, read the browser console for
errors, and confirm every image actually loads. Fix what you find, then show a
screenshot at both widths.

Then list in your reply: the files created, which placeholders the owner needs
to fill in, and one sentence on what makes this site better than the situation
described in "Why this business".
