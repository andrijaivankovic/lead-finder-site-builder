description: Build one lead start to finish with the saved autopilot settings, asking nothing
argument-hint: <place_id or business name>
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob
---

Take the lead that `$1` names from a row in a search result to a finished demo
site and three drafted messages, using the autopilot settings saved on the
Settings page of the browser. Ask nothing. Every answer `/build-brief` would
ask for is already in those settings, and every other decision below names its
default.

`{venv python}` below is the Python inside `venv`: `venv/bin/python` on macOS and
Linux, `venv/Scripts/python.exe` on Windows. Check which of the two exists in the
project folder and use that one. Never a bare `python`.

Substitute every `{...}` before running a command. Never paste one into a shell
as it stands.

Never send anything and never log anything as sent. The person reads the
messages and sends them.

## 1. Prepare

```
{venv python} scripts/autopilot.py prepare "$1"
```

It finds the lead, downloads its stock photographs unless they are already
there, and writes the answers from the settings into a file. It prints JSON
naming that `answers_file`, the `stock_folder`, the `project_folder`, the city,
the site language, the sender name and the portfolio links.

## 2. Check the photographs

Read every `description` in `sources.json` in the stock folder against the
trade, then open every hero and interior photograph and look at it. Remove each
one that plainly shows another kind of business, or another business's name or
logo on a window, a cup or a board:

```
{venv python} scripts/autopilot.py drop-photo "$1" {file} {file}
```

`{file}` is the path as `sources.json` writes it, such as `hero/hero_123.jpg`.
Do not search again. One photograph fewer is fine; somebody else's sign in
front of the owner is not.

## 3. Write the brief

Read the answers file and add what only judgement can give. Leave every value
already in it exactly as it is.

- `sections`, `seo_keywords`, `trade` and, when the file has none, `style`,
  exactly as step 4 of `commands/build-brief.md` describes them.
- `language`, when the file has none: the language most people in that city
  speak.
- `city`, when the file has none, read from the lead's address or its Maps link.

Then:

```
{venv python} scripts/build_brief.py "$1" --answers {answers_file} --stock {stock_folder}
```

## 4. Build the site

Follow steps 1 and 2 of `commands/build-site.md` for the project folder: read
`brief.md` and build exactly what its **Build prompt** asks for.

For a stack with a build step, install and build from the project folder with
`npm --prefix {project_folder}/site install` and
`npm --prefix {project_folder}/site run build`, so the finished bundle lands in
`site/dist/`.

Then check it:

```
{venv python} scripts/check_site.py {project_folder}
```

Fix every problem it lists and run it again until it passes. When you also
have a browser preview tool, serve the site and look at it at 360px and at
desktop width, as step 3 of `commands/build-site.md` describes. Without one,
the check is the last word, and the person looks at the site in the browser
page afterwards.

## 5. Draft the messages

Write the three versions exactly as step 3 of `commands/draft-outreach.md`
describes, in the site language, signed with the sender name and carrying every
portfolio link that step 1 printed. Where the sender name is empty, sign with
`[your name]` rather than inventing one.

Save them to `outreach.md` in the project folder under exactly these three
headings, so the browser page can show each one with a copy button:

```
## Email
## Viber or WhatsApp
## Instagram
```

The email starts with its `Subject:` line.

## 6. Report

One short paragraph: the folder, whether the check passed, the placeholders the
owner has to fill in, and that the messages are in `outreach.md`.
